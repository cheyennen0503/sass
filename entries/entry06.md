# Setting Up the Final Project
This week was tough in regards to actually starting this big project. For the first couple of days, I spent my time actually thinking about what it was I wanted to build and how it would look. So, I jotted down some basic ideas that I was thinking so I at least have something to follow. <img src="../img6.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /> I ended up deciding that I want to create a portfolio of myself. I chose this idea because not many people can say they built one from scratch incorporating their coding skills into it. 

## MVP
My MVP, or minimal vial product, was the main focus for this week meaning that with whatever idea that I have, create the most basic idea of it and then build on from there. I spent a lot of time tinkering with my older websites to refresh my memory into what goes in a website and how it works. I used the website that I created last year as a template for my portfolio.

## Next Steps
1. Continue working on my MVP (the basic idea of what I want my website to look like).
2. Look at some examples of websites that utilize SASS so I can find some inspiration. 

## Takeaways
+ It is imperitive that you create a layout of whatever you are trying to do or make. This way you are not diving in head first into something as big as this project. Know what you are going to do and plan it out so you have some kind of structure or idea.
+ Use all of your resources. Look back at old projects or notes that could be beneficial to what you are trying to make. For example, since I am attempting to create a website, I am looking at previous websites I have built to help guide me.
