# Entry 1: Intro / Plan

For the past week, I have been looking into what topic I would be most interested in learning about for the next 9 weeks in my Software Engineering Program. I had to find a topic that would both grab my attention and one that I can be creative with. My ultimate goal is to create something that will be useful to either myself or to the general public. As I was doing my research on topics, I was drawn to Ruby on Rails because I had just finsihed my attempt on creating my own application with my knowledge on MVPs (Model-View-Controller). Ruby on Rails is a framework that delves in deeper to what ruby is capable of doing on the backend of an application. I turned this idea down because I had trouble with simple Ruby, so learning a more advanced type of Ruby would not seem like the smartest idea. I then had the idea to learn Firebase. Firebase is a way to make your application a little more user friendly (interactive). I turned this idea down because I did not feel like I could create something of much use to myself or to others within a matter of 9 weeks. I then stumbled upon an amazingly-named programming language called SASS.
