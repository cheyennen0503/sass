# Entry 3: Codecademy


## Next Steps


## Takeaways

+ Plan accordingly! Do not spend too much time on one resource. There are plenty out there that can be very helpful to the topic that you are trying to learn. 
+ Find what works for you. This bullet point pertains to the previous one meaning if you spend too much time on something that you are just not understanding, move on. (This is essential! Know when to go in a different direction to "unstuck" yourself).
+ Code along. If you are doing something like codecademy, tinker a little bit with it. Build something small to see if you are truly understanding what you are learning.
