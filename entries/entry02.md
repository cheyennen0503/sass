# Entry 2: Research

For week two, it has been strictly research. In the SASS website's documentation, I delved deep into the first six topics: features, syntax, using SASS, CSS extentions, comments, and sassscript. 

## Important Things I Learned 

I learned that SASS can be run by ruby as a gem or on the command line. SASS can also update as a file is changing meaning SASS is flexiable. There are about 25 different options that have different fuctions varying from how you want the SASS file to update as you are changing your file to catche options that speed up the functionality of SASS and gives it a pathway to debugging. I learned that you can decide between SASS and SCSS syntax by accessing it in the command line and it runs based on the file extention that it is linked to if it has one. There are nested properties such as fonts that makes the code look easier to read because you do not have to type the leading word over and over again. You can just type font once and then write size style and color. You can set variables with SassScript that make it eaasier to use the same item over and over again. You can make variables global. SassScript has eight different data types. Maps have key/value pairs similar to a hash. Lists are created by spaces or commas. Lists are powerful because you can have one within itself. Parenthesis are very important. You do not use them in a list but you need to with maps. You can use operations in SASS that allow you to find a set number for something with other numbers that you already have. While there was a lot more information than this in the documentation, this is what I can grasp and what I felt was most important to grasp as or right now about these topics as of right now. I have learned something about myself; while I am good at retaining information, I am not very good at decfering or comprehending information that is either new to me or that I have had trouble with in the past. 

## What Was the Most Difficult Topic to Grasp and Why?

One topic that was most difficult to grasp was operations. I do not understand fully how or why they would be used when you can just write the number. It seems like a lot of extra work to put down more numbers. I am thinking that SASS just has it as an option if you wanted to do simple math, or maybe that is just not the overarching point of using operations. I also do not understand sting and color operations. I am not sure why strings would be needed in CSS and I am not sure how and why color operations work and are necessary. 


## Takeaways

One takeaway that I have for this week is if you do not understand something, google it. When studying something on your own, what you do not understand is not going to come to you. If a specific topic is iffy or is completely confusing, there is almost always a simpler explanation to help you to better understand. 

## Next Steps (Focal Points for Next Week/Topics I Need to Focus On)

My next step is to finish up reading the last half of the documentation and watch this YouTube video I found that I am hoping will help me better understand all the documentation I have read. Or at least, help me visualize how SASS will work. I also plan on tinkering and seeing how the topics I learned today like variables and nested properties will help me create what I intend on creating (undecided).
